# awesome-rust-selfhosted

Let's be honest, I'm a rust zealot, and I don't want to run PHP, Python, Javascript, or god-forbid Java, in my homelab.

This repository is to collect a list of all self-hostable services that are written in Rust. It's fine of the frontend of the service isn't written in Rust, but the backend needs to be.

_If you know of software that meets the criteria, please create a pull request_

## System Management

- [RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com/) - Access a machine remotely. Like TeamViewer, etc, but with a self-hosted option
